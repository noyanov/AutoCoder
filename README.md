# AutoCoder

Objectives
For this stage, perform the following tasks:

Initialize a new public GitHub repository that will contain the configuration files for GitHub Action and the scripts to interact with ChatGPT.

Name the repository AutoCoder;

Add a README.md file explaining the project;

Create a .github/workflows/ directory that will hold the future workflow files;

Create a new directory scripts/ that will hold the script files;

Create a new empty file in the .github/workflows/ directory: main.yml;

Create a new empty file in the scripts/ directory: script.sh;

Your repo should have the following structure with no additional files:

AutoCoder/                   # Root directory of the project
    │
    ├── .github/                 # Hidden directory for GitHub-specific files
    │   └── workflows/           # Directory for GitHub Actions workflow files
    │       └── main.yml         # Contains workflow file main.yml (empty for now)
    │
    ├── scripts/                 # Directory for custom scripts
    │   └── script.sh            # Bash script to interact with ChatGPT (empty for now)
    │
    └── README.md                # Project description file
